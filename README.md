# Bootstrap-Portfolio
## Description

This project was a chance to improve on my last Portfolio Project linked here: <br>https://kaleims.github.io/Kaleim-Portfolio/.
 Bootstrap was a big help in achieving a design that was responsive and catches the eye. I also learnt a'lot more about how the different Bootstrap compentents work as well as layouts using rows and columns and also utilities which is like the icing on a cake. This project was big for me because I am starting to see progress in a'lot of different areas, such as my Branches and Commits. Im ready to see what tomorrow holds.
